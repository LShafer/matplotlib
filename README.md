# Unit 5 | Assignment - The Power of Plots

## Data Analysis & Conclusions
1 - Rural areas have fewer Pyber drivers and the highest average fares. One possible explanation for this is that rural rides cover longer distances, thus increasing the cost. In order to explore this further, we would need access to information about the average number of miles per ride, which was not provided in this dataset. <br>
2 - Urban areas have the highest percentage of Pyber drivers and also the lowest average fares. One possible explanation is that the large number of available drivers pushes the fares lower due to supply and demand. It could also be explained by the average travel distance (i.e. shorter rides in an urban city), but that would need further study. <br>
3 - Although suburban areas account for a smaller percentage of total rides, they do have a higher average fare when compared to urban areas. Again, mileage or ride length information would be helpful in determining if this relationship is caused by a longer average travel distance.

## Pyber Ride Sharing

The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, you've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.

You've since been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Your objective is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

∙ Average Fare ($) Per City<br>
∙ Total Number of Rides Per City<br>
∙ Total Number of Drivers Per City<br>
∙ City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)<br>

In addition, you will be expected to produce the following three pie charts:

∙ % of Total Fares by City Type<br>
∙ % of Total Rides by City Type<br>
∙ % of Total Drivers by City Type<br>

As an example, the pie charts should look like this:<br>

As final considerations:<br>

You must use the Pandas Library and the Jupyter Notebook.<br>
You must use the Matplotlib library.<br>
You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.<br>
You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspects like: Plot Titles, Axes Labels, Legend Labels, Wedge Percentages, and Wedge Labels.<br>
Remember when making your plots to consider aesthetics!<br>

You must stick to the Pyber color scheme (Gold, SkyBlue, and Coral) in producing your plot and pie charts.<br>
When making your Bubble Plot, experiment with effects like alpha, edgecolor, and linewidths.<br>
When making your Pie Chart, experiment with effects like shadow, startangle, and explosion.<br>
